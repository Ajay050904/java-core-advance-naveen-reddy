1-> What is Data?
    . Data is a collection of facts and information.
    . The entire software industry works with data.
    . Programming languages process data, databases store data, and AI understands or generates data.

2-> What are Data Structures?
    . Data Structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently.
    . Efficiency is measured in:
                            Performance (speed)
                            Memory usage 
    . Definition (Exam):
                    Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data efficiently to improve performance and reduce memory usage.

3-> Why Do We Need Data Structures?
    . To search, insert, delete, and process data faster
    . To save memory
    . To store large amounts of data efficiently --> [Less memory is used ("memory efficiency")]
    . To improve application performance --> [Programs run faster ("better performance")]

4-> What is the difference between data and data structure?
    . Data is raw information, while a data structure defines how that data is organized and stored.

5-> What is an algorithm and pseudocode?
    . An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
    . Pseudocode is a language-independent way of writing an algorithm using simple English and programming logic.

6-> Can you give a real-life example of data structures?
    . A contact list uses arrays or lists, social networks use graphs, and file systems use trees.




NOTE->
******
    . Software applications (calculator, banking apps, Amazon, Instagram, etc.) work by executing "algorithms", which are step-by-step instructions to process data. These steps are first written as "pseudo code" (language-independent logic) and then converted into actual programming code.

    . Companies focus heavily on "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)" because:
        1. They improve application speed and user experience.
        2. They reduce computational costs (cloud, servers, processing).
        3. They help companies filter skilled candidates during hiring.
        4. They show that a developer understands problem-solving and system efficiency.
