* "Q: Explain Data, Data Types, and Data Structures"

Data:
    > Core of all software applications
    > Taken from user, processed, displayed, or stored in databases

Variables
    > Used to store data
    > Can be imagined as a "box" holding data

Data Types:
    > Define the type of data a variable can store
    > "Primitive (system-defined) types:"

    * `int` → numbers
    * `float / double` → decimal values
    * `string` → text
    * `char` → single character

* "User-Defined (Complex) Data Types"

  * Used when primitive types are not enough
  * Represent real-world entities (Human, Phone, Student)
  * Examples:

    * `struct` in C
    * `class` in OOP languages

* "Data + Operations"

  * Every data type supports operations
  * Integer → add, subtract, multiply, divide
  * String → length, concatenate, substring

* "Storing Multiple Data"

  * Use "arrays, lists, sets"
  * One structure stores many values
  * Supports operations like insert, delete, search, access

👉 "One-line Summary:"
Data is stored using variables and data types, and data structures help store and manage multiple data efficiently with defined operations.


1-> What is Abstract Data Type (ADT)?
    . Definition:
                1-> Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a data type that defines data and the operations on that data without specifying the implementation details.
                2-> ADT is a logical description of a data structure that defines data and operations but not the implementation.
    . A conceptual model
    . Defines what data is stored
    . Defines what operations can be performed
    . Does N  OT specify how it is implemented
    . 📌 Implementation may differ from language to language, but the concept remains the same.
    . Examples of ADT:
                    Array
                    List
                    Stack
                    Queue
                    Set
                    Map
    . Components of ADT:
                    1-> Data
                    2-> Operations on the data
    
2-> Why is it called “abstract”?
    . Because it hides implementation details and focuses only on behavior and operations.

3-> What is the difference between data type and ADT?
    . A data type specifies how data is stored, while ADT specifies what operations can be performed.

4-> Does ADT depend on programming language?
    . No, the concept remains the same; only implementation changes.

5-> Why is ADT important?
    . It helps in designing efficient programs and choosing the right data structure.
    . It separates "logic from implementation", making programs easier to design and maintain

6-> Is stack an ADT or data structure?
    . Stack is an "ADT"; its implementation using array or linked list is a "data structure".

7-> Can one ADT have multiple data structures?
    . Yes, For example, Stack can be implemented using array or linked list.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ADT is a "logical concept"                                             | Data Structure is a "physical implementation** |
| It defines "what data is stored" and "what operations are allowed"     | It defines "how data is stored" in memory     |
| Focuses on "behavior"                                                  | Focuses on "implementation**                   |
| Does "not" specify memory or algorithm                                 | Specifies memory layout and algorithms          |
| Independent of programming language                                    | Language-dependent                              |
| Example: Stack (push, pop)                                             | Example: Stack using array or linked list       |
| Example: Queue (enqueue, dequeue)                                      | Queue implemented using array or linked list    |
| Used in "design phase"                                                 | Used in "coding phase"                        |

NOTE:
*****
    > ADT defines what operations can be performed on data, while Data Structure defines how those operations are implemented.
    > ADT → Rules of a game
    > Data Structure" → How the game is actually played on ground
    > 📌 Memory Tip (1 Second Recall): 
                                    ADT = WHAT
                                    Data Structure = HOW
