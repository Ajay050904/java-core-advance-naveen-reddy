### **Q: Explain Data, Data Types, and Data Structures**

**Answer (Concise Points):**

* **Data**

  * Core of all software applications
  * Taken from user, processed, displayed, or stored in databases

* **Variables**

  * Used to store data
  * Can be imagined as a **box** holding data

* **Data Types**

  * Define the type of data a variable can store
  * **Primitive (system-defined) types:**

    * `int` → numbers
    * `float / double` → decimal values
    * `string` → text
    * `char` → single character

* **User-Defined (Complex) Data Types**

  * Used when primitive types are not enough
  * Represent real-world entities (Human, Phone, Student)
  * Examples:

    * `struct` in C
    * `class` in OOP languages

* **Data + Operations**

  * Every data type supports operations
  * Integer → add, subtract, multiply, divide
  * String → length, concatenate, substring

* **Storing Multiple Data**

  * Use **arrays, lists, sets**
  * One structure stores many values
  * Supports operations like insert, delete, search, access

👉 **One-line Summary:**
Data is stored using variables and data types, and data structures help store and manage multiple data efficiently with defined operations.


1-> What is Abstract Data Type (ADT)?
    . Definition:
                Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a data type that defines data and the operations on that data without specifying the implementation details.
    . A conceptual model
    . Defines what data is stored
    . Defines what operations can be performed
    . Does N  OT specify how it is implemented
    . 📌 Implementation may differ from language to language, but the concept remains the same.
    . Examples of ADT:
                    Array
                    List
                    Stack
                    Queue
                    Set
                    Map
